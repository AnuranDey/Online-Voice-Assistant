Hi, I have created JARVIS by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a voice assistant that executes your commands!! 
Just ask JARVIS like:
"Open Google!"
"Whats the weather or temperature?"
"Open Youtube"
"Search for [any keyword you would like to search]"
"Open my INSTAGRAM profile!"
and many more...

It Can even greet you just say "Hi JARVIS!!"

But before doing anything you have to provide your very basic details. Those information will be stored in your localstorage. It can also show batteryhealth, Wifi connectivity and WEATHER REPORT after getting your LOCATION   from your provided details.
